			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>So I've completed my Associates Degree at Ranken Technical College in 2013. I plan going to a four year university once I've figured out exactly what i want to specialize in my IT career. Right now I provide Technical Support for multiple Technolgies ranging from hardware such as Laser and dot matrix printers, Laptops desktops and tablets. To software suck as VMware citrix receiver Windows 7,8 and Server 2008. I've also worked with the ancient AS\400's along with mutiple other technologies.If the future I am looking to specialize in something although Im not sure exactly what yet.This website is kind of a personal project for me to work to and determine if programming is something I would be interested in doing in the future. I would like to as they say test the waters before I dive into programming and making it my major at a university.</p>
